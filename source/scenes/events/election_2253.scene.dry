Since we are currently ruling as part of an emergency government, we may use quasi-constitutional trickery to significantly delay these elections, and continue governing via Article 48. This is likely to be extremely unpopular both with our base and with the other parties. However, this may be necessary to prevent the extremists from gaining power.

- @cancel_elections_2: Yes, do it.
- @election_algorithm: No, let's hold the elections.

Even though the Barons are very reluctant to participate in such a coalition, they still accede to President Tibbet's wishes. Thus, a majority center-right coalition is formed, with de la Cruz as chancellor.

There is no path to an obviously workable majority. Since President Hindenburg is unwilling to work with a minority or caretaker Long Spring government, his preferred chancellor is Heinrich de la Cruz of the Tandist Party, who could lead a "presidential" government.

There is no path to a majority government. President Hindenburg is tired of the chaos, and appoints Franz von Papen as chancellor instead of de la Cruz. Papen is a indenpendent formerly from the Tandist Party, and is significantly to the right of the majority of the Tandist Party.

Papen is immediately faced with a vote of no confidence, given his unpopularity. However the Long Spring votes, he is guaranteed to fall, due to the unanimous hatred against him from all other parties.

There is no path to a majority government. One option would be to have a continuation of the current de la Cruz government; if we tolerate it, then it would retain a majority vote against no-confidence.

Alternatively, we could try to form a "new grand coalition" of all constitutional parties except the NSDAP, Pass Party, and Barons. The stumbling block are the minor conservative parties such as the "Economic Party of the Middle Class", who detest any hint of socialism and would ruin the country before working with Marxists.

The third option is to have new elections.

There is no path to a majority government. Hindenburg is displeased with Papen, and calls on him to resign. Now, former army general Kurt von Schleicher has been appointed chancellor, again as part of a presidential government.

Schleicher's government is deeply unpopular among all parties of the Congress. Despite his support for a coalition with the NSDAP, the Nazis want power all to themselves, without Schleicher.

There is no path to a workable Congress majority or minority government. The next elections are set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

The people's faith in democracy is shaken by this ordeal. Of course, the Nazis are exploiting the instability to claim that democracy is unworkable, and that the New California Republic needs a strong leader.

We have decided to tolerate de la Cruz's government. This means that we will vote against no-confidence votes to make sure they fail, but also that we will not be directly participating as ministers in the government. Thus, we can prevent a new election and stop the far right from entering government.

@grand_coalition_fail

Unfortunately, the Business and BVP are unwilling to enter into another coalition with the Long Spring, so the grand coalition is unable to be formed.

Under the influence of Gustav Stresemann, the Business agrees to allow us into the coalition, and so does the BVP.


@dvp_conservative

The Business asks us to adhere to their conservative economic policies (that is, extreme austerity and labor discipline) in exchange for us joining the coalition.

- @beg_dvp_2: But they would not have a majority without the Long Spring! The Barons and NSDAP have no interest in participating in government.

@beg_dvp_2

Somehow, we succeed in convincing them! We are now in a coalition.

As expected, the Long Spring is the largest party, and this time, we are expected to take the lead role in the formation of the next government, including selecting the speaker.

Are we sure about not participating in government? This will cause significant internal dissent, and will lead to increased distrust from the bourgeois parties. Even debating this option causes internal backlash. In addition, it is possible that the bourgeois and right-wing parties will also be unable to form a coalition government, leading to a regime appointed by President [+ president +].

Since the remaining bourgeois and right-wing parties cannot form a tolerable governing agreement, new elections have been called for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +]. The previous chancellor has resigned, and has been replaced by Heinrich de la Cruz, also of the Tandist Party, ruling as part of a presidential cabinet. 

We are seen as responsible for the failure to form a government, and many of our middle-class and even some working-class supporters have deserted the party.
