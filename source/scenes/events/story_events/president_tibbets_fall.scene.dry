title: The crumbling facade
subtitle: Weak, unpopular and indecisive. President Tibbet has little going for themselves. 

With the new election merely months away, President Tibbet is trying everything in his power to try and keep control over the New Californian Republic yet the support it just not there. This is our chance to make major inroads with either the Taddist party by promising to support them or to break the status quo and make a future for ourselves.

@support_president_tibbet
on-arrival: Q_tandist_relation + 10; Q_tandist_right_relation + 10

The President personally thanks us for the support bonding our parties together in these difficult times.


@oppose_president_tibbet
on-arrival: Q_tandist_relation - 10; Q_tandist_right_relation - 10; Q_tribal_spring -5; Q_military_spring +5; Q_rural_spring +10

Publicly opposing the President destorys our relations with the Tandist parties and makes coalition partners grumble. Tribal voters are also disgusted by our actions but in return we manage to muster frontier, rural and military voters to believe in us.


@remain_unaligned
on-arrival: Q_workers_spring +10; Q_resources +1; Q_urban_dissent -5; Q_frontier_dissent -5; Q_intelligentsia_dissent -5; Q_old_worlder_dissent -5

Instead of involing ourselves into this affair, we decide to focus on campaigning and internal party dissent to prepare us for the up coming election. After all if we win we cannot afford to waste time settling grudges.
