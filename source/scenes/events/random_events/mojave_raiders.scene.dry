# // 38 NCR citizens are massacred by Mojave raiders.[551] President Joanna Tibbett's reaction is considered timid by NCR Congress, and she is soon voted out, replaced by Wendell Peterson.[551]
# // TLDR: Mojave raiders killed 38 people in the Mojave borderlands in 2253. 1 year before the game start. This event line follows those raiders. 
# // This event line should only trigger in arc one and mostly follows how the government responds to the threat at the Mojave border.
# // This event line has been changed from it's previous form which was about random bandit raids, I didn't like it.

# // So, basically the event can be split into 4 "paths". Send the army itself and make everyone happy including those at home but risk losing army strength + Money.
# // Send the private paramilitary of the New Spring party to win some real political favour on the borderlands but the paramilitary will take some hefty losses unless it's well equiped which is unlikely
# // Do nothing and piss the frontier folk off a lot, and embolded the Mojave raiders. If the raiders are embolded too many times special events will start triggering
# // TO DO: an NPC will respond themselves based on a number of conditions


= Mojave Raiders

The Mojave Raiders seem to operate on a tempo, they don't constantly pressure our citizens in the Mojave which makes it difficult to justify a long term allocation of forces. Yet, if we don't respond to them the tempo of raiding only grows more violent. A token response at least is usually a must but the expense to both life, political capital and the treasury to send soliders so far from their homes is a hard one to justify. Citizens at home often believe that living on the borderlands brings a life of risk that they should come to expect and not demand hands outs from the urbanites.

- @employ_the_army: Despite the cost, we will send the army to secure the Mojave for this month, we'll scare the raiders off with the might of the republic.
- @send_road_wardens: Our own organised military loyal to the party will be sent out to win the hearts and minds of the sufferers.
- @Let_it_happen: Living on the borderlands is cheap on life and land, they knew what they were signing up for.

subtitle: Thousands are sent however what exact tactics will be taken against this bandit threat?
unavailable-subtitle: We do not control the military at this time, this is out of our hands.

As the military readys it's approach to the bandits, we must decide exactly how we will deal with this issue. We can send thousands into the harsh wasteland to find the bandits at their very source. We can scare bandits away with a show of force or we can focus on helping rebuild ruined communities.

@manhunt
title: Bloody Manhunt
subtitle: Every inch is covered, every rock and cave checked. Thousands die but we push the bandits back, if we keep this up they might become a non-factor in due time.
on-arrival: frontier_dissent += 5; ncra_strength -= 2; ncra_militancy -= 2; mojave_raiders_timer += 4 

Our Soliders die trying to flush these bandits out, we aren't equiped to handle such small scale raids yet the frontier is safe for another day and this does keep the bandits away for longer than usual.


@toothless_show_of_force
title: Toothless Show of Force
subtitle: A quick in and out. We will show our weapons, fire some shots and quickly dart back to the capital. It should keep the bandits away for some time.
on-arrival: frontier_dissent += 3; ncra_strength -= 1; ncra_militancy -= 1; mojave_raiders_timer += 3

Farms are burnt, lives are ruined however we didn't waste our military manpower on minor matters. However the Bandits are embolded by our lack of defences.

Subtitle: The Grizzly's have denounced the rest of the parties and the government for not doing anything, gathering a lot of popular appeal in the process.
