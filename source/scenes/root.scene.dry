> *"When President Tandi, the Mother of California, peacefully passed away in 2248 after an eventful 52 year presidency, many were hopeful that her successor, one Joanna Tibbet, would continue her legacy.  And for a time, the republic prospered. With few enemies capable of threatening the heartlands, it expanded rapidly across most of pre-war California. It signed treaties, incorporated new towns, sent settlers to claim new lands and territories far from it's core. It brought peace, justice, and trade wherever it's reach extended. But the image of invincibility was shattered when 38 citizens of the NCR were massacred at the entrance to the Mojave Wasteland. President Joanna Tibbet flounders with indecision, unsure of what course to take, as the NCR Congress plots behind closed doors..."*

It is a tumultuous time for Californian democracy. After a period of stable rule, the very foundations of the Republic have begun to be shaken. With true parties forming, contact being made with outside parties, a time of opportunity and change has finally come.
