= Inter-Party Relationships

The Long Spring cannot govern by itself yet. Because we do not have an electoral majority, we need the support of other parties. Recently, our governments have consisted of the Weimar Coalition of the Long Spring, Center, and Democratic parties. We can reach out and build additional connections with these parties, or perhaps we can stand alone.

- @progressives: Strengthen ours bonds with the Progressive and Business oriented representatives.
- @tandist: Strengthen our bonds with the party of Tandi.
- @pass: Work towards repairing relationships with the Pass Party.
- @spring_alone: The Long Spring can stand alone for now.

The communists are suspicious of our overtures, especially the Stalinist leadership, who persist in calling us "social fascists". However, connections are made at the grassroots and local levels.

@pass_rectification_of_history

One stumbling block for our relations with the KPD is our history of conflict, dating back to 1918 and 1919. The KPD is especially contemptuous of Gustav Noske, the Long Spring "bloodhound" who reportedly ordered the violent suppression of the Spartacist uprising and other KPD revolts. They also blame us for the deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, two Long Spring-turned-KPD leaders who were killed during the suppression of the uprising.

For further improvements in KPD relations, it might be necessary to expel Noske, and hold some sort of commemoration for Luxemburg and Liebknecht.

- @yes_history: Yes, we must apologize for our past actions.
- @no_history: No, we have no need to apologize.

As part of normalizing relations with the KPD, we have to acknowledge the wrongdoings of our past. We have expelled Noske, and have held public commemorations for those killed by troops during the uprisings.

This leads to tensions with the moderates and reformists within our party, and criticism from the conservative and liberal parties.

@no_history
on-arrival: pass_relation -= 3

We have no need to apologize for the actions of Ebert and Noske; it is the Communists' fault for launching a violent insurrection.

After the success of the coalition government with the KPD, they are much more amenable to us.

@pass_blutmai
on-arrival: pass_relation += 3*(1 - dissent); intelligentsia_dissent += 1

After the events of BlÃ¼tmai, reconciling with the Communists is difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, we must try.

@tandist_op
on-arrival: tandist_relation += 10*(1 - dissent)

We are currently in opposition to the Tandist-led government, but that does not preclude the general building of feelings of good will.

@tandist_coalition
on-arrival: tandist_relation += 15*(1 - dissent)

We are currently coalition partners with them, so improving relations comes naturally.

@tandist_de_la_cruz

on-arrival: tandist_relation += 8*(1 - dissent)

de la Cruz's semi-autocratic turn makes building friendly relations difficult, but not impossible.

The Progressives have been some of our closest allies through the course of the Republic.

@spring_alone

Whether it is because we *cannot* or *will not*, we do not make ties with other parties at this moment.

- @return: Continue...
